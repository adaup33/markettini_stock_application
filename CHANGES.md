# Changes Made to Fix Routing Errors (2025-10-19)

This document summarizes the precise changes made during this session to fix the 404 on the sign-in page and related routing behavior.

## What was going wrong
- The sign-in (and sign-up) routes were placed under a folder named `{auth}`: `app/{auth}/sign-in/page.tsx` and `app/{auth}/sign-up/page.tsx`.
- In the Next.js App Router, route groups must use parentheses `(` and `)`, not curly braces. A folder named `(auth)` is treated as a route group and omitted from the URL; `{auth}` is treated as a literal path segment.
- Because of this, navigating to `/sign-in` returned a 404 (the actual path was `/{auth}/sign-in`).

## Changes implemented
1. Renamed the route group folder from `app/{auth}` to `app/(auth)` and moved its contents as-is.
   - Moved files/directories:
     - `app/{auth}/layout.tsx` → `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
     - `app/{auth}/sign-in/page.tsx` → `app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`
     - `app/{auth}/sign-up/page.tsx` → `app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
   - Result: `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` routes are now correctly reachable.

2. Verified that the protected root layout still redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.
   - `app/(root)/layout.tsx` contains `redirect('/sign-in')` when there is no active session.
   - With the route group fixed, `/sign-in` now resolves correctly.

## Notes (not changes)
- Middleware status: The project currently has middleware at `middleware/index.ts`. Next.js expects a single file named `middleware.ts` at the repository root. As-is, this middleware will not run.
  - If you want the middleware active, move/rename to `middleware.ts` at the root and keep the matcher exclusions for `sign-in`, `sign-up`, `api`, `_next/*`, `favicon.ico`, and static assets.
  - This was not changed in this session because it is optional for resolving the 404.

- Inngest setup: No changes were required. The 404 was unrelated to Inngest.
  - Client: `lib/inngest/client.ts`
  - Function: `lib/inngest/functions.ts`
  - Route handler: `app/api/inngest/route.ts`

## How to verify
1. Restart the dev server so Next.js picks up the folder rename.
2. Visit `/sign-in` (e.g., http://localhost:3001/sign-in). You should see the sign-in page.
3. Visit `/sign-up` to confirm the sign-up page renders.

## VCS note
Depending on your git tooling, the folder rename may appear as a delete/add of the files from `app/{auth}` and a corresponding add in `app/(auth)`. This is expected for a directory rename.

# Middleware fix (2025-10-19)

- Added a root-level `middleware.ts` so Next.js can load middleware.
- Kept and verified `export const config = { matcher: [...] }` at the end of the file, as required by Next.js to scope the middleware.
- Updated the unauthenticated redirect target from `/` to `/sign-in` to avoid a redirect loop and align with your auth flow.
- Note: The previous `middleware/index.ts` is not used by Next.js; only `middleware.ts` at the repository root is recognized.

How to verify:
- Restart the dev server so Next.js picks up `middleware.ts`.
- Visit a protected route (e.g., `/`) while logged out; you should be redirected to `/sign-in`.
- Visit `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`; they should be accessible and not redirected.
